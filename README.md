  i)A circuit showing how to interface an 8086 microprocessor with 8255 PPI. The circuit runs on Proteus v8.0 and above <br>

  ii) 2 files of Assembly code for ATM and Shift Encoder. Compile the code into an EXE in an emulator preferrably emu8086. Add the executable to the properties of the 8086. <br>
